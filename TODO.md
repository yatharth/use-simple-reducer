# TODOs

These are separate from the `// TODO` comments sprinkled throughout the code.


## TODOs to consider

- Add more comments to source
- Expose way to create reducer to use in tests
- Make selectors draft-safe (https://redux-toolkit.js.org/api/createSelector)


## TODOs I’m not going to do

- **Use semantic-release with Github Actions**

  _[meh, project not complex enough to justify this over just `npm publish`]_

- **Upgrade dependencies on react and @reduxjs/tookjit devDependencies**

  _[meh, this doesn’t really help anyone]_

- **Automate Git workflow with husky, commit linters, test runners etc.**

  _[meh, project not complex enough to justify this]_

- **Use jest for testing**  
 
  _[meh, project not complex enough to justify this]_

- **Use eslint**

  _[meh, I use my IDE; project doesn’t have multiple contributors to justify this]_
